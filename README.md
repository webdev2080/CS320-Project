CS 320 Software Test Automation

You are a software engineer for Grand Strand Systems, a software engineering company that focuses on developing and testing back-end services. You’ve been given an assignment to develop a mobile application for a customer. The customer will provide you with the requirements. Your job is to code up the application and provide unit tests to verify that it meets the customer’s requirements. You will be delivering the contact, task, and appointment services. The purpose of these services is to add, update, and delete contact, task, and appointment objects within the application.

How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?
  In order to ensure that the code, program and or software is functional and secure in an application, 
  we must handle and commit consistent test services in order to move through each feature in the program.
  While maintaining correct code format and following specific standards in the industry, we can use this and 
  the ability to cross check individual tests to maintain a functional and secure application.
  
How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?
  In order to interpret user needs while incorporating those needs into a program
  we must first put ourselves in that same users perspective when attempting to understand exactly
  what they are wanting. This is a must in the software field as it becomes the foundation
  of the design of an application.
  
How do I approach designing software?
  Before beginning a project or code at all, we must identify the needs of the consumer,
  create a goal for the project and create an effective game-plan or strategy to handle the problem
  at hand while developing a proper solution.
